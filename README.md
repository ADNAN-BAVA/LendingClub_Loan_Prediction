## üìÑ Project Overview

This project explores the application of **Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)** for predicting loan defaults using the LendingClub dataset. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and addressing class imbalance with **SMOTE**, this project aims to enhance credit risk modeling and support financial decision-making.

Key highlights:
- Development of multiple DNN architectures to identify patterns in high-dimensional, imbalanced financial datasets.
- Implementation of hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- Final tuned architecture achieves a **98.17% test accuracy**, outperforming traditional methods and previous research.

## üîë Key Features

- **Multiple DNN Architectures:** Experiments with architectures of varying complexity, including dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
- **Class Imbalance Handling:** Use of Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (**SMOTE**) to balance the dataset.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and detailed classification reports.
- **Visualization:** Correlation heatmaps, FICO score analysis, and learning curves for insights into data and model performance.

## üìä Results

The project demonstrates the power of **Deep Neural Networks** in handling complex, non-linear relationships in financial datasets. Below is the performance summary of the best architecture:

| Architecture | Optimizer | Epochs | Test Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|--------------|-----------|--------|---------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Tuned DNN 3  | Adam      | 100    | **98.17%**    | 0.98      | 0.98   | 0.98     |

## üóÇ Dataset

The project uses the **LendingClub dataset**, a publicly available dataset containing detailed loan and borrower information. Key features include:
- Borrower FICO scores
- Loan amounts and interest rates
- Credit policies and repayment statuses

### Preprocessing Steps:
1. **Feature Engineering:** One-hot encoding of categorical variables such as loan purposes.
2. **Normalization:** Standardizing continuous features for better model training.
3. **Balancing Classes:** Using SMOTE to handle imbalances in loan repayment statuses.

## üìÄ Model Architectures

### Architecture 3 (Best Performing Model):
- **Input Layer**: Standardized feature set.
- **Hidden Layers**:
  - 1024 neurons, ReLU activation, Dropout (0.3)
  - 512 neurons, ReLU activation, Dropout (0.3)
  - 256 neurons, ReLU activation, Dropout (0.3)
  - 128 neurons, ReLU activation, Dropout (0.3)
- **Output Layer**: 2 neurons with SoftMax activation.
- **Optimizer**: Adam with hyperparameter tuning.
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy.

## üîß Tools and Libraries

- **Deep Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras
- **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Class Imbalance Handling:** imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
